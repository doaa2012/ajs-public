\section{Introduction}
	The Frechet probability distribution, named after the French mathematician Maurice Frechet who developed it in 1925. It is a continuous probability distribution, also known as the inverse Weibull distribution. The Inverse Rayleigh and Inverse Exponential distributions can be considered as special cases of the Frechet distribution \citep{mosilhy2022cubic}. The Frechet probability model is used to model maximum values in a data set. It is used to model a variety  of phenomena, such as flood analysis, horse racing, human lifespans, maximum rainfall and river discharge in hydrology. The Frechet distribution is used particularly in the field of engineering reliability. It can also be used to model a variety of failure characteristics such as infant mortality, useful life, and wear-out periods. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the Frechet distribution and the probability density function (PDF) are defined as follows:
